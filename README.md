## Personal expenses tracker ðŸ’µ

Project was created with ReactJS frontend and backend using Google's firebase cloud services.
You can sign up, authenticate if that happened already and start populating the database with your expenses.

Essentially, it was created to be used by my girlfriend and me for track our expenses. Not as if we couldn't find any other app to use, but the project was also created as a learning porpuse.

Bye.
